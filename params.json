No data usage necessary. \r\n\r\n### A Innovative Use of Wearable Tech\r\n\r\nUtilizing \"MUSE the brain sensing headband\", Focused Driving analyzes brain wave signals and accelerometer data to detect eye-closing, head nodding, and gradual changes in lethargy of an individual. These types of data provide not only emergent alerts, but also predictive warnings as a prevention for tiredness related accidents. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nDennis Liu \r\n\r\nDebarun Gupta\r\n\r\nNeil Lohana \r\n\r\nDaniel Pang\r\n\r\nJason Du\r\n",
