### A Driving Safety Application 

Focused Driving is the project of a team of 4 Engineering students to improve safety on route for lethargic drivers. 

### A minimalist Android Application 

Built on the widely used android platform, Focused Driving provides a simple user interface that relies on minimal processing power, and requires only Bluetooth connection. No data usage necessary. 

### A Innovative Use of Wearable Tech

Utilizing "MUSE the brain sensing headband", Focused Driving analyzes brain wave signals and accelerometer data to detect eye-closing, head nodding, and gradual changes in lethargy of an individual. These types of data provide not only emergent alerts, but also predictive warnings as a prevention for tiredness related accidents.
